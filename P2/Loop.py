        Defines a loop in a pipe network.  Note: the pipes must be listed in order.  The traversal of a pipe loop
        will begin at the start node of Pipe[0] and move in the positive direction of that pipe.  Hence, loops
        can be either CW or CCW traversed, depending on which pipe you start with.  Should work fine either way.
